    "text": "2a. Position Sizing Methodology\nThe fund’s position sizing follows a risk-quality composite framework — not equal-weighting. Each stock’s target weight is derived from three factors:\n\nSharpe/Volatility Score — higher Sharpe per unit of volatility → higher weight. This is equivalent to a risk-parity tilt but penalises pure-momentum stocks with extreme volatility (e.g., Suzlon capped at 4.2% despite Sharpe of 1.80 due to 56% annualised volatility).\nROCE Premium — stocks with ROCE ≥ 25% receive a 10–20% weight premium. In a long-time-horizon sectoral fund, quality of capital deployment compounds. Cummins India (38% ROCE) and ABB (35% ROCE) receive premium weights reflecting this.\nPolicy Anchor Bonus — NTPC and Power Grid are public-sector utilities with regulated returns and government-backed balance sheets. They receive explicit overweights as the fund’s defensive core — portfolio anchors during periods of risk-off selling.\n\n\n\nPortfolio Concentration Metrics\n\n\n\n\nMetric\nFund\nNifty 50 (approx)\n\n\n\n\nNumber of Holdings\n20\n50\n\n\nTop-5 Weight\nnp.float64(35.2)%\n~34%\n\n\nHerfindahl-Hirschman Index\n0.0544\n~0.035\n\n\nEffective N (1/HHI)\n18.4\n~28\n\n\nMax Single Position\nnp.float64(8.5)% (NTPC)\n10.1% (RIL)\n\n\nWeighted Avg P/E\n43.5x\n23x\n\n\nWeighted Avg ROCE\n19.9%\n~14%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipOn Cap vs Floor\n\n\n\nNo single position exceeds 8% to prevent over-concentration in any one regulatory regime. A minimum floor of 1.5% ensures no purely token positions — every holding must earn its seat in the portfolio. NTPC and Power Grid together constitute the defensive anchor at 14% of AUM."

It confirms that the outperformance is structural, not a one-year anomaly."
